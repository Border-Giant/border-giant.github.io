                    <p>Vendors usually assume that the address that they ship to is the final destination of the goods and collect tax for that state. However, there are scenarios where the address given at checkout is simply the first stop of an unbroken transportation chain, and the purchaser has hired a logistics company to complete the rest of the transportation. The final destination is where the goods leave the transportation chain and the purchaser takes possession. In cases where the goods are exported to a foreign country, the purchase will pay the appropriate taxes for the country of the final destination. When the vendor is informed of this and presented with documents to support that taxes were not applicable to the sale, they are responsible for refunding the inappropriately collected taxes to the purchaser.</p>

            <h1 class="text-center text-primary">How Border Giant Helps</h1>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-12 align-self-center">
                    <h3 class="text-primary text-center text-md-start">Our Aim Is to Help Vendors and Customers Easily Process These Tax Refunds</h3>
                    <p>We do this by engaging with the vendors to determine their specific process and required documents for issuing the refund. For a lot of vendors, we simply search their website to find their public policy, and then automate the process. For example, Amazon.com lists their policy online here (Link). So, when a shipment from Amazon is received at our warehouse in Minnesota, our system automatically generates the Bill of Lading (customized with additional information to help process the tax refund) and sends an email with the PDF document and all the requested information, and instructions to the client. All the client has to do is forward the email to Amazon's tax exemption email address, and they receive a refund. We have hundreds of vendors in our system, including Walmart, eBay, Etsy, Wayfair, and tons of other wholesalers and retailers. We are adding more every day.</p>
                    <p class="mb-5">Some vendors don't have the relevant policy posted publicly, and in those cases, we reach out to the vendor directly to obtain it. We then add their refund process to our system and automate it. We have dozens of vendors in our system and are adding new ones all the time. Even if we don't have the vendor in the system, we still generate all the proper documents to legally show that the goods were exempt as never having left the transportation stream in Minnesota. The customer can often reach out directly to the vendor to receive the refund.</p>
                    <h3 class="text-primary text-center text-md-start">What if the Vendor Refuses the Tax Refund?</h3>
                    <p>Though it is rare, there have been vendors who refuse to address the issue or provide a process for refunding or exempting the tax. In these cases, Border Giant has received advice on how to proceed. Vendors have a legal obligation to properly collect taxes on behalf of the state. This also means that they have a legal obligation to NOT collect tax, when it should not be collected. Border Giant does not have standing to seek legal remedies against vendors directly, unless we have been over-taxed ourselves. What we do is make sure all of the following conditions are being met, on behalf of our customers.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The vendor has been made aware that the shipments are tax exempt and we have made multiple attempts to work with them to receive a process to apply the exemption. This usually involves emails, providing legal memorandum to help understand the process, phone calls, and even registered letters to the accounting or legal departments asking for assistance in the matter. The key is to establish that the vendor is making an informed choice to continue collecting taxes on shipments they are well aware are exempt.</li>
                        <li>When we process a shipment on behalf of a client, we email the vendor the request for the refund along with all of the information they would need to issue the refund. We also attach the standard documents the vendor would need for record-keeping to comply with Minnesota law. The client who has been taxed is also cc'd on the email so the vendor may engage directly with them.</li>
                        <li>We keep records of every request that has been made for a refund by all clients, and keep detailed accounts of all the attempts that had been made to engage with the vendor.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If the customers who have been inappropriately taxed wish to pursue legal action against the vendor (either as individuals or as a class), we are able to supply a detailed account proving the vendor was aware that the shipments were tax-exempt, yet chose to collect tax on behalf of the state. We are also able to supply proof that the vendor choose to over-tax as a matter of policy and that it was not an isolated incident.</p>

                <div class="col-md-6 align-self-center">
                    <p>Have you ever wondered why online vendors and marketplaces now collect sales tax? The landscape of online commerce changed with the landmark Supreme Court case of Wayfair v. South Dakota in 2018. Before this ruling, online retailers were not always required to collect sales tax unless they had a physical presence, such as a brick-and-mortar store, in the state. However, the Wayfair decision expanded the authority of states to require online sellers to collect and remit sales tax, even if they don't have a physical presence. This change aims to level the playing field between online and offline retailers, ensuring fair competition and providing states with additional revenue to support vital services and infrastructure. These changes also brought in Marketplace Facilitator Laws. Before, sites like eBay, Amazon, and Etsy didn't have to collect sales tax as they were not actually selling the products. Now, Marketplaces that facilitate the sale of goods are responsible for collecting taxes.</p>

            <h1 class="text-center text-primary">Why Do Vendors Collect Minnesota Tax for My Orders?</h1>
            <div class="text-center"><img class="img-fluid img-md mb-4" src="images/img-ship-to-address-is-not-equal-to-final-destination.svg" alt="ship to address is not equal to final destination"></div>
            <p class="mb-5">Most vendors make the assumption that the address they ship the product to is the address where the shipment will leave the transportation chain. So the address that you enter as the "ship to" address usually triggers the vendors' system to add sales or use tax assuming that the zip code entered is where the shipment will leave the transportation chain. Though this is not an unreasonable assumption (and is likely the case over 99% of the time), there are many instances where the address the purchaser enters at checkout is simply the first stop in an unbroken transportation chain to another state or country. Or the address could be a licensed Public or Bonded Warehouse. Items that are in transit, or stored in a Public Warehouse have not left the interstate commerce chain and can not be taxed by the state. If the item is collected by the buyer in Minnesota or is delivered to a non-registered address (like a hotel or unregistered parcel receiving agency) a taxable event occurs, even if the goods are eventually exported.</p>

                    <p>In Minnesota items such as clothing, textbooks, food, and health products are not taxable. If you ordered these items online, the vendor would not have charged state tax at checkout.</p>
                    <h3 class="text-primary text-center text-md-start">The Vendor Is Exempt From Collecting State Tax</h3>
                    <p>Minnesota has a Small Seller Exception for remote sellers. If a vendor has under 200 retail sales shipped to Minnesota and less than $100,000 in retail sales shipped to Minnesota, they are exempt from collecting Minnesota sales tax (provided they also have no physical presence in Minnesota).</p>

                                <p>While there is a lot of truth to this, it is not "technically" correct. Taxes can be collected by the government where the goods reach their final destination. Though the address that the vendor ships to may be the final destination of the goods most of the time, that is not always the case. There will be scenarios where the initial "ship to" address is just the first leg of the transportation chain, and the shipment has a final destination in a different state or different country. Or the address could be a licensed Public Warehouse, in which case the goods could be stored there for a long period of time and still be legally in the interstate commerce stream. For most of our clients, the final destination of the goods is Canada and we ensure the goods do not leave the transportation chain in Minnesota. Once the vendor is made aware (and provided documentation) that the final destination was not Minnesota, they would be responsible for adjusting the collected tax accordingly. This would mean refunding the Minnesota state tax collected at checkout.</p>

                                <p>This is another misunderstanding of how the tax laws work. State-level exemption certificates are for when the state has the jurisdiction to collect tax on a transaction, but they provide an exemption to the entity making the purchase. For example, a reseller or a charity in Minnesota may be exempt from sales tax, and they would prove this by submitting a state level exemption document. However, goods processed by Border Giant remain in the interstate commerce stream the entire time that they are in Minnesota. Goods in the interstate commerce stream can not be taxed by states, due to Federal Constitutional clauses. State-level tax exemption documents are not relevant as the state had no jurisdiction to collect taxes in the first place. As an alternative to state level tax exemption certificates, Minnesota law allows vendors to "prove by any other means", that the transaction was tax exempt. In cases where the goods remain in the transportation chain through Minnesota, documents like the original sales invoice, Bills of Lading, Waybills, Public Warehouse receipts, Shipping Documents, Delivery Receipts and customs clearance documents can all be used to support the tax exempt status of the shipment as goods in transit.</p>

                                <p>Border Giant has engaged at length with the Minnesota Department of Revenue on the subject and they have confirmed that they do not have a process to issue tax refunds in these situations. Minnesota can not issue refunds to entities that do not have a US tax ID. The vendor is responsible for the proper collection of sales tax. In these cases, the refund or exemption would need to be processed by the vendor.</p>

                                <p>Depending on what software the vendor uses, there is likely either a direct process or a "workaround" in the software provider's documentation. This usually allows the vendor to adjust the destination address and store the appropriate documentation. Minnesota law does shift the responsibility of proper collection from the vendor to the certified SST compliance software provider, when the software provider is contracted to facilitate tax compliance services. However, the software providers usually have to put certain language in the contract stating that the vendor is responsible for providing accurate information, including the final destination of the goods. Their position tends to be that if the vendor is made aware that the address entered at checkout is not the final destination, and are provided documents to support that, the vendor is responsible for making the appropriate updates using the software. Whatever the case may be, not having a fully functioning software system does not remove the responsibility to collect taxes appropriately.</p>
